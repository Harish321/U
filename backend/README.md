# **BACK-END** Application

## WHAT IS A BACK-END?
> The back-end is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:

1. **The server.** This is the computer that receives requests.
2. **The app.** This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
3. **The database.** Databases are used to organize and persist data.
## WHAT IS A SERVER?
> A server is simply a computer that listens for incoming requests. Though there are machines made and optimized for this particular purpose, any computer that is connected to a network can act as a server. In fact, you will often use your very own computer as server when developing apps.
