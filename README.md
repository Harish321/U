# U
A revolutionized learning application.

Well, all these modern languages, frameworks and application are desigend to solve certain type of problems we all face all the time in this computerized world. BUT over a period of time the number of such type of languages,frameworks and applications are increased rapidly, i.e there would be more than one language or framework or application to solve the same problem, which unfortunately created a lot of confusion for the people to adpot particular language and to proceed furthur, which is the exact reason for us initiate this project called U.

With the help of U, we are trying to create an overview of how different languages,frameworks and applications approached to solve the exact same problem which we face in any type of web application and U is not limited to only web-applications, but for starter we are adopting worlds most commonly used platform.

Enough about U let's get in to the details,

As we mentioned we have selected web-applications as our starter project and we have segrigated the web-application majorly in to four parts and we call them as design blocks of web application.

those are:
  1. Front end
  2. Back end
  3. Database
  4. Devops&Hosting
  
All the above blocks have their own set of requirements to meet to give a proper justifiaction to there name and now we are going to list down the requiremnts and how different lanugages & frameworks implmentaion for those requirements.

[FRONT END | BACK END]
[DATABASE | DEVOPS]

1. [FRONT-END] Minimum Requirements of the Front End Block.
  // List Goes here.
 
2. [BACK-END] Minumum Requirements of the Bank End Block.
  // List Goes here.

3. [DATABASE] Minumn Requirements of the databases.
 // List Goes here.
 
4. [Devops] Minimum Requirements of the devops.
 // List Goes here.
