# U
A revolutionized learning application.

Well, all these modern languages, frameworks and application are desigend to solve certain type of problems which we all face all the time in this computerized world. BUT over a period of time the number of such type of languages,frameworks and applications are increased rapidly, i.e there would be more than one language or framework or application to solve the same problem, which unfortunately created a lot of confusion for the people to adpot particular language and to proceed furtur, which is the exact reason for us to initiate this project called U.

With the help of U, we are trying to create an overview of how different languages,frameworks or applications approached to solve the exact same problem which we face in any type of web application [U is not limited to only web-applications, but for starter we have adopted world's most commonly used platform.]

Enough about U let's get in to the details,

As we mentioned we have selected web-application as our starter project, we have seperated the web-application majorly in to four parts and let's call them design blocks of web application.

those are:
  1. Front end
  2. Back end
  3. Database
  4. Devops&Hosting
  
All the above blocks have their own set of requirements to meet, to give a proper justifiaction to their name and now we are going to list down the requiremnts against each block and will see the implimentations of most popular languages/frameworks in those respective blocks to fulfill the requirements.

[FRONT END | BACK END]
[DATABASE | DEVOPS]

1. [FRONT-END] Minimum Requirements of the Front End Block.
  // List Goes here.
 
2. [BACK-END] Minumum Requirements of the Bank End Block.
  // List Goes here.

3. [DATABASE] Minumn Requirements of the databases.
 // List Goes here.
 
4. [Devops] Minimum Requirements of the devops.
 // List Goes here.
